Heap Sort
=========

I decided to implement heap sort after watching a lecture on MIT open courseware (before app academy attendence)  

This is my implementation along with 3 other implementations I found of heapsort on the internet commented accordingly.

All implementations are in Ruby.

Results of the tests are commented inside the code.  
The tests were performed on a Macbook Pro dual core 2.5 Ghz i5, 4GB ram
